Biro UI is a modern design system project created by Kuroji Fusky with simplicity in mind - with the twist of blending gradients and subtle blur to stand out its content.

It's 100% framework agnostic so you don't have to worry about fiddling around with your favorite JavaScript framework!

Biro UI is inspired by other design systems, notably Fandom Wiki, Material UI, and MDL (Microsoft Design Language)

Currently work in progress!
